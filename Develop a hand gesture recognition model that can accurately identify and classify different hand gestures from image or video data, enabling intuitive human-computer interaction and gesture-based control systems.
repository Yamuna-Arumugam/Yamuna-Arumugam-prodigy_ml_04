To develop a hand gesture recognition model in Python, we can use the OpenCV library for capturing video frames and processing images, and a pre-trained deep learning model such as MobileNetV2 for feature extraction and classification. Here's a basic example to get you started:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2
from tensorflow.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2 import preprocess_input
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import img_to_array
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model
model = MobileNetV2(weights="imagenet", include_top=False,
                    input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Load the pre-trained gesture recognition model
gesture_model = load_model("gesture_model.h5")  # You need to train and save this model

# Define the classes for gestures
gesture_classes = ["Gesture1", "Gesture2", "Gesture3"]  # Add your gesture classes here

# Define the video capture device
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # You can change the argument to the video file path if you have one

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    if not ret:
        break

    # Preprocess the frame for MobileNetV2
    preprocessed_frame = cv2.resize(frame, (224, 224))
    preprocessed_frame = img_to_array(preprocessed_frame)
    preprocessed_frame = preprocess_input(preprocessed_frame)
    preprocessed_frame = np.expand_dims(preprocessed_frame, axis=0)

    # Extract features using MobileNetV2
    features = model.predict(preprocessed_frame)

    # Classify the gesture using the pre-trained gesture recognition model
    prediction = gesture_model.predict(features)
    predicted_class_index = np.argmax(prediction)
    predicted_class = gesture_classes[predicted_class_index]

    # Display the gesture class on the frame
    cv2.putText(frame, predicted_class, (50, 50),
                cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0, 255, 0), 2)

    # Display the frame
    cv2.imshow('Hand Gesture Recognition', frame)

    # Break the loop when 'q' is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the video capture device and close all windows
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

In this example:

- We use OpenCV to capture video frames from a webcam or a video file.
- We preprocess each frame to match the input shape expected by MobileNetV2 and pass it through the model to extract features.
- We use a pre-trained gesture recognition model (which you need to train and save separately) to classify the extracted features into different gesture classes.
- We display the predicted gesture class on each frame.

Make sure to replace `"gesture_model.h5"` with the path to your trained gesture recognition model file. Additionally, you need to train the gesture recognition model on your hand gesture dataset and save it before using it in this script.
